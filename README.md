MyDexChain is fully docker compatible and please follow [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/), [Centos](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/), [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), [Amazon Linux](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html), [MAC OS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) installation steps before running MyDexChain Node. After docker installation open a command line || terminal and run command to check the docker version.

```
docker -v
```

## Usage

##### 1. Run MyDexChain:

MyDexChain docker file is stored in dockerhub and ready for use with command: (Please check the version and use as tag rather than latest)

```
docker run -d --rm -p 2020:2020 -v mydexchain:/var/lib/postgresql/ --privileged --log-driver=none --name mydexchain mydexchain/mydexchain:latest
```

After docker container **comes up** run the command;

```
docker ps
```

> **Output**: db641c6c55b7   mydexchain/mydexchain   "/startup.sh"   32 seconds ago   Up 31 seconds   0.0.0.0:2020->2020/tcp, 5432/tcp   mydexchain


##### 2. Follow Blocks:

```
docker attach mydexchain
```



##### 3. Node RestAPI commands :

```
"http://{DockerHostIP}:2020/setDextracker/{dexTrackerNumber}”
```
- `dexTrackerNumber : DexChain Tracker Number`
```
“http://{DockerHostIP}:2020/isWallet/{address}”
```
- `address: Dexchain Address`
```
"http://{DockerHostIP}:2020/balanceWallet/{address}"
```

```
“http://{DockerHostIP}:2020/createWallet/{password}”
```
- `password: Dexchain Address password “Please Don’t Forget it”`
```
"http://{DockerHostIP}:2020/getTransactions/{address}&{limit}”
```
- `address: Dexchain Address`
- `limit: number of records`
```
"http://{DockerHostIP}:2020/sendTransaction/{sender}&{password}&{receiver}&{amount}&{fee}&{contract}&{description}"
```
- `sender : Sender Dexchain Address`
- `password: Dexchain Address password`

## FAQ

### How Can I Calc Fee

### Where Can I Run MyDexChain Node?
You can run MyDexChain Node on
- `Amazon Web Services`
- `Azure`
- `Google Cloud`
- `Your Own Server/Desktop`

### How Can I Update to the Latest MyDexChain Version?
Run the command on Current DockerHost:

```
docker kill mydexchain && docker pull mydexchain/mydexchain && docker run -d --rm -p 2020:2020 -v mydexchain:/var/lib/postgresql/ --privileged --log-driver=none --name mydexchain mydexchain/mydexchain:latest
```


### Common Problems
These options are settings that change shell behavior. The following table is a list of options that might be useful to you:

| Check | How         | 
| :---: | :---------- | 
| Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?  | Check your docker service is up and running.|
| Block Sync is not working  | Check your internet connectivity. |

### How to Backup the MyDexChain Node?

MyDexCahin maps blocks inside PostgreSQL and it has been addressed inside dockerfile. All the data is saved inside **`/var/lib/docker/volumes/mydexchain`** and make sure that you **backup** the folder.


25000 myDexChain Transaction = (1000 x 0.003) + (9000 x 0.0003) + (15000 x 0.00003) = 6.150 Fee

``` 
docker kill mydexchain
```

##### 2. Copy `/var/lib/docker/volumes/mydexchain` to Backup Path:
